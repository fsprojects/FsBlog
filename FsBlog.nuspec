        <description>FsBlog aims to be a blog-aware static site generator, mostly built in F# for .NET and Mono developers. But don't worry, you won't even need to know any F# to get up and running. So long as you are comfortable using a command line or terminal, and have a degree of familiarity with Markdown and Razor syntax - you're already most of the way there!

Inpired by the likes of Jekyll and Octopress - and greatly helped along the way by the scripts behind @tomaspetricek's personal website; FsBlog gives the average .NET or Mono dev the tools that they need to get a statically built website up and running quickly and hosted somewhere like Github Pages.

This set of tools have been pulled together using some of the following community projects:

    FAKE for automation and scripting of the different tasks.
    F# Formatting for Markdown and F# literate programming, processing and colorization.
    RazorEngine which is used for the templating and embedded C# code.
    Some of the code in FsBlogLib that calls the RazorEngine has been based on F# code in Tilde.
    Github Pages for our default theme.</description>
