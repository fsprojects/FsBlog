<h1>Hello, FsBlog!</h1>

@RenderPart("tagline")

<p><strong>FsBlog</strong> aims to be a blog-aware static site generator, mostly built in <code>F#</code> for .NET and Mono developers. But don't worry, you won't even need to know any F# to get up and running. So long as you are comfortable using a command line or terminal, and have a degree of familiarity with Markdown and Razor syntax - you're already most of the way there!</p>

<p>Inpired by the likes of <strong>Jekyll</strong> and <strong>Octopress</strong> - and greatly helped along the way by the scripts behind <a href="https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">@@tomaspetricek</a>'s personal website; FsBlog gives the average .NET or Mono dev the tools that they need to get a statically built website up and running quickly and hosted somewhere like <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</p>

<p>This set of tools have been pulled together using some of the following community projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/">FAKE</a> for automation and scripting of the different tasks.</li>
<li><a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/">F# Formatting</a> for Markdown and F# literate programming, processing and colorization.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Antaris/RazorEngine">RazorEngine</a> which is used for the templating and embedded <code>C#</code> code.</li>
<li>Some of the code in <strong>FsBlogLib</strong> that calls the <strong>RazorEngine</strong> has been based on F# code in <a href="https://github.com/aktowns/tilde">Tilde</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> for our default theme.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>It is very early days and we haven't yet reached anything vaguely resembling a version 1.0 of the software.</p>

<p>You can track the progress of the development, outstanding issues and check what we're working towards by checking out the <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FsBlog/issues">Issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FsBlog/milestones">Milestones</a> sections of our repository.</p>

<p>If you find a bug, or have a request or whatever - please raise a new issue there! or even better make the change and open a pull request.</p>
